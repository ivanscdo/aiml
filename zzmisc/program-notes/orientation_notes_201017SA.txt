check delivery schedule!


weekly quizzes, 20-30% weight, 10marks
projecjts, 60marks, 
attendances, 10% 
certificate: >=60%


inform program manager before hand
try to do not miss projects/assessment
cannot extend deadline, but can take alt project - edge cases


will be divded into groups of 14-16, mentored learning sessions, whatsup group, project discussion forums

video lectures released during week, weekend mentore learning sessions, program support ticket on olympus

sessions recorded and available 

exp with python, math, statistics?
statistical inference - use data to derive insight, provide value. 
ml practiioners perspective - build best model, highest accuracy, best prediction, etc. 

program designed from practioners pov.

deep learning - linear algebra, matrix multiplications, (at the end of the day it's all tables). 

statistics before vs today
don't need to know all formulas, but know how/when to use, how to code, how to interpret outputs. 

all relevant learning material will be provided, reach out if feel we need additional material. 

career counseling?
take approach: understanding of field in general, when to use what, how to approach problems, what to do when things don't work.

current climate, roles not standard yet
roughly: 
analytics - data to decision, like a function, hr, finance
data science - field/domain, solving problems
data engineering - managing dw, capturing errors

olympus overview:
attendance only for mentored learning sessions
excelerate tab only available after 60% program completed
