---why python?

Python one of most popular programming languages, general purpose lang, web, db, gaming

Chosen as aiml, can handle all parts of data science, collecting data, processing, visualization, dashboard. 

Rich library and functions. Don't need low-level code. 

Ex: shay prof write func to random sample 1-10. In python, just call random library. 

Python has huge community

Easy to deploy in production. 

Support new state of the art tech (deep learning)

Deep learning first developed in c++/java


---q's
peer: Issue with kite, uninstall anaconda, reinstall everything 


anaconda - distributed package manager

q: Default directory for Jupiter?

a:Cd to directory, then start jypiter from directory. jypiter root directory based on where it's started in terminal


---common python libraries
numpy - handling multi-dimensional arrays
scipy - science python; linear equations, simple funcs like average, max in array, etc
matplotlib, seaborn - visualization, similar but seaboard easier to use
Pandas - arrays & data frames, influenced from R


---Common variables
int
float
boolean
string

Import numpy as np
A = np.array(range(10))
np.random.permutation(a)

String stored as array in python

---python list vs numpy array

py_1 = [i for i in range(10000)]
len(py_1


---list, tuple, dictionary 

List mutable
Tuple immutable 
Tuples are faster and consume less memory
Dictionary  - key/value pairs

---numpy

Pandas originally written for stock market, based on numpy
numpy2 in dev

Assignment

Pandas series is already numpy array, supports all functions

---groupby()

Similar to pivot tables in excel

Will get uberdrive-2.csv
